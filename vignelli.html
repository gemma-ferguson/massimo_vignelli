            Introduction</h3>


        <p>Massimo Vignelli is known as arguably one of the world’s most important leading characters in the history of modern design, with his work expanding across the design disciplines from graphic design, architecture and interior design, to the design of the New York City subway map. He transformed our world with his use of functional design building corporate identities for some of the world’s largest companies, such as Bloomingdale’s or American Airlines.  </p>
        
        <img src="images/vignelli-portrait.jpg" class="textwrap" alt="Photograph of Vignelli">

        <p>Born in Milan in 1931, Vignelli worked in many companies throughout his lifetime, including teaching at The New Bauhaus in Chicago in 1957, creating the Unimark design company with partners in 1964 and starting the Vignelli centre in 2008. Unfortunately, he passed away in New York in 2014 aged 83. </p>
        
        <p>This essay will focus on research that will show why he is one of the most important icons within modern design. It will briefly look at Vignelli’s style and examples of his work until it focuses on arguably his main success within his career, the New York City subway map and other pieces paired with this, such as the signage also created and also comparing it to the new map created. My essay will aim show how his career progressed, what methods he used and why Vignelli was so successful.</p>

    The Style</h3>

        <p>Vignelli is known for creating the famous New York City subway map and other design systems that are still in use to this day. The main reason for his success is that his designs are always based off the user’s true needs with a great focus on the functionality of the design above the aesthetics— not unlike the Bauhaus Movement. His timeless style is used in a practical, balanced and visually appealing nature throughout his work teaching us to appreciate the functionality of simple shapes paired with a use of white space, as Vignelli himself said </p> <blockquote>“Almost all the great American graphic designers have used white space as the significant silence to better hear their message loud and clear.”</blockquote> <p>His work relates back to the period of modernist design which followed World War II, Vignelli and other designers during this time took these rules which were implemented by movements such as De Stijl and Bauhaus and refined them further to create their style. In my opinion, the work Vignelli creates has a clear link to the period of modernism due to its simplistic style but it is sophisticated in its use of shapes, colour and typography to create strong and impactful logos and identities for a variety of companies and organisations such as Knoll, IBM, US National Parks service, American Airlines and Bloomingdale’s. </p>

        <p>His style and legacy has impacted so many designers of this age, along with other key designers he made the use of white space, typography, shapes and colour more appealing to young designers while the popular style of postmodernism was starting to come to a close. </p>

    Corporate Identities</h3>

        <p>Alike Vignelli, within the sector of Interaction design we are constantly designing with the user’s needs and the functionality of the design in central focus. This can be seen through various pieces of his work as they are modern and simplistic, reducing logos he creates down to the simplest forms for example within the corporate identity he created for Bloomingdale. Within the logo he broke down Futura, the classic Bauhaus style typeface, removing the extra details so only the main foundations of the typeface remained, he merged the letter O’s and created a simplistic and modern style logo out of a 13-letter word. </p>
        
        <img src="images/bloomingdales.jpg"  class="center" alt="Bloomingdale's Logo">

        <p>Another example would be the American Airlines logo he created in 1967, it initially consisted of two As in Helvetica typeface, one red and one blue. Also it included a simplistic representation of the eagle which the company had insisted was included.  The pairing of the red and blue along with the eagle reinforces the origin of the company while he used Helvetica for legibility and as Vignelli said</p> <blockquote>“It was the perfect type.”</blockquote>

        <p>These examples are two of the greatest corporate identities that Vignelli created in his career, Bloomingdale’s lasting until this day and American Airlines lasting numerous years before being rebranded but keeping the principals that Vignelli had implemented. These are just two examples of the work that Vignelli created during his career and are two large reasons why he is one of the most important icons within modern design.</p>

    New York Subway Design System</h3>
        
        <p>How many artists in the world can say that their work impacts over one million people a day? Very few, and due to the design of the signage and map in the New York Subway Vignelli is one of these people. Vignelli’s work with the subway map is probably the most iconic and one of the highlights of his career. </p>
        
        <img src="images/vignelli-map.png" class="textwrap1" alt="Vignelli's New York Subway Map">

        <p>The map and signage was designed to help people navigate around four of the five boroughs within New York, prior to Vignelli’s designs I would describe the subway as chaotic and unorganised with various styles of signage making it almost impossible to navigate throughout the system which lacked any logic or pattern. The design that Vignelli came up with was revolutionary as it transformed the traditional geographical accurate map to simplified diagram form only using horizontal, vertical and 45° lines while distorting the shape of New York and the length of the subway lines to aid the clarity of the map. Vignelli termed it as </p>
        
        <blockquote> “the most beautiful spaghetti work ever done. It’s terrific. And it’s so clear, it’s unbelievable.” </blockquote> 
        
        <p>This revamp gave the subway a new sense of modernity. Throughout the map and signage, he used Helvetica and their type standards as it is easy to read and its simple form paired well with the diagrammatic style. When it was first created in 1972 the map was initially harshly criticized and not used due to how different it was to the previous style and how it varied to the geographical layout of the city. In 1979, the map was replaced by a more geographically accurate map but still to this day Vignelli’s signage remains.</p>

        <p> Various things have been changed since the design system was implemented in 2008 such as the map, it has been made a lot more complex and has changed from the simplistic line and dot system that Vignelli implemented. </p>
        
        <blockquote>“It’s very simple. Every subway line on the map has a color, and in reality they already have one. And every station has a dot, you know. Every stop is a dot—no dot, no stop. It couldn’t be easier than that.” </blockquote>
        
        <p>Vignelli himself said this about the map today 
            
        <img src="images/new-map.png" class="textwrap2" alt="The remade New York City subway map">
        
        <blockquote>“Instead, if you look at today’s map, it’s a total disaster, with fragmentation all over the place. I can show it to you. And this is what we tried to avoid.” </blockquote>
            
        <p>I tend to agree with him on this matter, when we compare the two maps personally I find Vignelli’s easier to follow and understand and when comparing this to the new map it is a lot harder to follow your line and find the stop you need. </p>
            
        <p>He has been known to also compare his map to the London underground map, stating that their map was more successful as it was so simple with no indication of the geography within the city which Vignelli had subtly tried to do, his map had indications of water and buildings using tones of beige and grey.</p>
